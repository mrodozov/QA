## User_Ldap Test Plan

Template: https://github.com/owncloud/QA/blob/master/Server/Test_Plan_user_ldap.md
FIXME: 
* Weed out CI items,
* clarify instructions  https://github.com/owncloud/user_ldap/issues/638#issuecomment-875106439
* integrate hetzner_deploy/task/openldap_config.txt into task/user_ldap.sh

### Setup

<details><summary>Setup details (click to view)</summary>

* vi tasks/user_ldap.sh -> ldap_server=95.217.210.161 (small server from below)
* `bash ./make_oc10_apps.sh user_ldap=0.15.3-rc4 windows_network_drive oauth2`
* `bash ./make_oc10_apps.sh user_ldap=0.15.2 windows_network_drive oauth2` (for upgrade testing!)


#### external storages:
 - windows_network_drive
 - SFTP


#### OpenLDAP:

Prepare two LDAP backends for testing:
1. big server
   - 1200 users, 50 groups via releases/oc10/apps/ldap/genusers.py
   - three base DNs (we initially configure only one to owncloud)
   - nested groups

2. small ldap server
  - less than 1000 users, less than 40 groups
  - two base DNs (we initially configure only one to owncloud)
