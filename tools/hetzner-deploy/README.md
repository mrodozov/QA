# Hetzner Deployment Scripts

The tools here can deploy the classic owncloud 10 (with loading and intializing many apps) or ocis or other installations into Hetzner cloud
(or anywhere with root access).
At Hetzner we normally use the hcloud API via pythin, but can also use terraform or the hcloud CLI.

The machines will be
- made accessible via ssh.
- have a unique hetzner-name and an rdns entry.
- start with some nice labels, (including some that start with 'fw.' -- those pull in default firewall rules for me.
- will leave an ssh connection open to the machine, with some further instructions. E.g. how to assign a fully qualified domain name
  and an ssl certificate using the cf_dns tools from the same repo.

## Example with full automation

* Have access to a project at https://console.hetzner.cloud (invitation accepted)
* Have a hcloud API token for the project project.
* Have a cloudflare API token. You need an account at cloudflare - My Profile -> Api Token Generate -> DNS -> include owncloud.works
* Have your public ssh key uploaded into the project. Below use the name of your ssh-key instead of `jw@owncloud.com`

By default, machine names are made unique by adding a random suffix of three letters, and a username-prefix derived from the first ssh-key (In my case hostnames start with `jw-`...)

Run from your local Ubuntu machine:

```
sudo apt install git python3
pip install hcloud
git clone https://github.com/owncloud/QA
cd QA/tools/hetzner-deploy

export HCLOUD_SSHKEY_NAMES=jw@owncloud.com
export HCLOUD_TOKEN=mZdZX......................................................L8bml
export CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN=........
./deploy_oc10_apps.sh --
```

## Simple example with manually created machine

* Create a machine, e.g. at https://console.hetzner.cloud/projects, record its IP-address. Used below.
* Make sure that you can login as root with ssh. If needed accept hostkeys and fingerprints.
* Run from your local Ubuntu machine:

```
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/owncloud/QA
cd QA/tools/hetzner-deploy

export OC_DEPLOY_ADDR=xx.yy.zz.aa
./make_ocis_test.sh
```


## Example with manually created machine and doing everything there

* Create a machine, e.g. at https://console.hetzner.cloud/projects, record its IP-address.
* Login as root with ssh there.
* Run from within that machine:

```
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/owncloud/QA
cd QA/tools/hetzner-deploy

export OC_DEPLOY_ADDR=localhost
./make_ocis_test.sh
```

## Scripts

All these scripts are independant entry points. Each of them deploys a specific setup
and gives some instruction for what to do next.

 * `env OC10_VERSION=1.9.1 ./deploy_oc10_apps.sh user_ldap richdocuments` -- start an owncloud connected to an ldap server, and a collabora server

 * `env OCIS_VERSION=v1.0.0-beta5 ./deploy_ocis_eos_compose_test.sh` -- run ocis (with specified git branch) on eos.

 * `./deploy_ocis_eos_compose_test.sh` -- run ocis with eos as docker compose. JÃ¼rgen's favorite entry point.

 * `./deploy_ocis_make_generate_build_test.sh` -- build ocis from source, and run the binary (without docker)

 * `./make_machine.sh` -- creates a machine and returns its IP address.
   This is a general purpose script, check out the command line options.
   In case of OC_DEPLOY_ADDR=localhost, an attempt is made to return the IP address associated with the default route.
   The other scripts are actually wrappers on this one. Read and modify them. (But don't read make_machine.sh -- it does magic).

In each case, wait several minutes, until the setup is done.
Follow the instructions on screen.

You can tear down a Hetzner machines either from https://console.hetzner.cloud, or by using the command line.
In both cases, you will be prompted with the machine name again, and will have to confirm.

  * `./destroy_machine.sh MACHINE_NAME` -- destroy one specific machine.

  * `./destroy_machine.sh "$USER-*"` -- destroy all machines prefixed with my user name. At the prompts you can say `yes` or `no` to select which ones to actually destroy.
  .
  * `./destroy_machine.sh` -- without parameters, it returns a listing of running machines that were made with terraform.
